Overview
This repository contains representative high-speed video data from experiments investigating flagellar dynamics of cells under periodic blue light stimulation at different intensities. The data are organized into two folders: HighLight and LowLight, corresponding to high and low blue light intensity experiments, respectively.

Experimental Description
Cells were exposed to 2 Hz square-wave blue light at either high (15,000 lx) or low (50 lx) intensities, mimicking natural periodic signals experienced by a rolling cell. High-speed videos were recorded at 3,000 frames per second to capture rapid flagellar movements. For quantitative analysis, we tracked changes in the beat plane for each flagellum over 10 stimulus cycles at both light intensities.

Sample Information
High light intensity:

7 cells imaged
20 measurements in total

Low light intensity:

7 cells imaged
24 measurements in total

Multiple measurements showed consistent results across samples.

Uploaded Data
Due to storage limitations, we have uploaded 5 representative videos for each light intensity condition (HighLight and LowLight folders).

Each video contains 4 cycles of square-wave blue light stimulation.

Videos have been compressed, but still clearly demonstrate the direction of flagellar beat plane reorientation.

If you require access to the uncompressed raw video data for justified research purposes, please contact Prof. Alan C. H. Tsang at alancht@hku.hk.
